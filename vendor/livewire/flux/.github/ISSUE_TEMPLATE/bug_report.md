Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for using Flux!

Many of the people who help resolve issues here are enthusiastic Fluxers like yourself who volunteer their time to support fellow community members.

To respect everyone's valuable time and help you resolve your issue as quickly as possible, before posting an issue, please:

* Make sure you have followed each step in the installation instructions: https://fluxui.dev/docs/installation (step 5 is optional)
* Update to the latest version of Flux by running `composer update livewire/flux livewire/flux-pro`
* Delete any previously published Flux components (to avoid usage of old versions)
* Run `npm run build` to compile all CSS and JS assets
* Clear the view cache by running `php artisan view:clear`

If these steps do not resolve the issue, please provide us with:

* A concise description of the problem
* Minimal, copy-pastable code (with no dependencies) to reproduce the bug (Volt components are great for this!)
* Screenshots if relevant

We will close this issue for any of the following reasons:

* The code snippets contain unrelated code such as left-over Blade variables
* We cannot reproduce the issue with the provided code snippets
* The issue is a duplicate

Thank you!
