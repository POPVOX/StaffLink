                    This chatbot is specifically trained using documents prepared by the Modernization Staff Association (MSA) to ensure that responses are aligned with best practices for congressional staffers. Additionally, the bot utilizes the OpenAI API, but responses are tightly constrained to the knowledge contained within MSA documents. As new resources are developed and integrated, they will be listed on this page to ensure transparency about the materials being referenced.
